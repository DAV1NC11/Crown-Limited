<h3>Welcome to Crown Motors! <i>Drive or be driven</i></h3>
<hr align=center width="40%"  color="red">
<h2><p>We noticed a shift in the way people shop and buy.<br>
  Created in 2018, Crown Motors Limited adopted the new online mode of trade. <br>
Consumers were no longer tolerating interruptive bids for their attention — in fact, they'd gotten really,
really good at ignoring them.<br>
From this shift, a company was born: Crown Motors Limited.<br> It was founded on "inbound",
the notion that people don't want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople — they want to be helped.<br>
Today, the inbound movement continues to empower businesses around the world to stop interrupting,
start helping, and return their focus to the customer.<br></p></h2>
